# INSTRUCTION-SET-ARCHITECTURE-ISA-JNU69
DEVELOPED AN I.S.A WHICH PERFORMS BASIC ARITHMETIC AND LOGICAL FUNCTIONS
I.S.A which understand user inputs(assembly language codes) and gives desired outputs.

â€¢Two pass assembler Implementation with hypothetical Instruction set architecture using C.

1)Pass 1 was to create separate the sym-bol table, mnemonic opcode table, and operand fields,determine the storage- required for every assembly language statement andupdate the location counter.

2)Pass 2 was to create machine code using the translation of opcode and symbolic operands,generate value defined by different datatypes.
